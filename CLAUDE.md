# Task Reminders

- Always read and write to Claude's memory (@CLAUDE.md) for task tracking.
- Use the TodoWrite tool to manage tasks during complex operations.
- Always work to check off one item in the todo list at a time, then return to the user for further instructions.
- Before editing, read the workspace and find the appropriate files.
